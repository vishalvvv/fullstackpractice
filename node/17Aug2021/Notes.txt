Middlewares:

If we want to perform any operation before hitting the actual API, then we need to 
use Middleware.

A middleware is a function with atleast 3 parameters such as request, response and 
next.

function auth(req,res,next){

}

There are 5 types of middlewares. 

1. Application Level Middleware 
2. Router level Middleware 
3. Built In Middlewares 
4. Error handling middleware
5. Third Party Middleware.
